This detector sets the following constraint types as master constraints:
- set packing constraints
- constraints with \f$\text{rhs}\geq 0\f$ and \f$\text{lhs}=-\infty\f$


### Algorithmic Details
This detector adds the aforementioned constraints to the master. This is done as follows:
* Iterate over all open constraints
 * If the constraint's type (determined in [preprocessing](#preprocessing)) is `setpacking`, fix it to the master
 * If the constraint's type is not `logicor` and not `setcovering` and not `setpartitioning`, but its right hand side is non-negative and its left hand side is -infinity, fix it to the master
