### Overview

| ID |          Full Name          | Propagate | Finish | Postprocess |

This detector detects [arrowhead](#arrowhead) structures through graph partitioning on **column-row hypergraphs**.

**Note:** This detector needs hmetis and works only under Linux/MacOS, it further needs the Z-shell (zsh)
to enforce memory and time limits on hmetis as this is the only shell reliably doing that.
