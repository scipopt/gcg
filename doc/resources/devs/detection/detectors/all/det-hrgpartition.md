### Overview

| `r` | hrgpartition                | âœ“ |   |   |

This detector detects [single-bordered](#single-bordered) structures through graph partitioning on **row hypergraphs**. This leads to decompositions without linking variables.

**Note:** This detector needs hmetis and works only under Linux/MacOS, it further needs the Z-shell (zsh)
to enforce memory and time limits on hmetis as this is the only shell reliably doing that.
