This detector sets the following constraint types as master constraints:
- set covering constraints
- logical OR constraints
- constraints with \f$\text{rhs}=\infty\f$ and \f$\text{lhs}\geq 0\f$


### Algorithmic Details
This detector adds the aforementioned constraints to the master. This is done as follows:
* Iterate over all open constraints
 * If the constraint's type (determined in [preprocessing](#preprocessing)) is `setcovering` or `logicor`, fix it to the master
 * If the constraint's type is not `logicor` and not `setpacking` and not `setpartitioning`, but its right hand side is infinity and its left hand side is non-negative, fix it to the master
