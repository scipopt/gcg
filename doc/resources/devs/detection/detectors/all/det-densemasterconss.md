This detector adds all constraints that have at least two variable coefficients that are closer than \f$1\f$ apart from another to the master constraints.

### Algorithmic Details

* Iterate over all open constraints (\f$N\f$ many)
 * For each constraint, get the number of nonzeros (\f$n_{\text{nonzeros}}=\f$`getNVarsForCons()`) and make a tuple of the two: \f$(n,c)\f$, with \f$c\f$ the constraint and add it to the list `l`
* Sort the tuples in `l` in ascending order by the first element (the neighborhood, higher means more dense).
* Set the `last index` to be \f$r_{max}*N\f$, with \f$r_{max}\f$ being the parameter "maximal ratio" (by default \f$0.2\f$)
* Iterate over all constraints
  * If the `last index` (i.e. by default the first \f$20\%\f$ of the constraints, starting with the greatest number of nonzeros) is reached, stop.
  * If the difference in nonzeros between the current item `l[i]` and the next item `l[i+1]` is smaller than the default `maximum difference index`=\f$1\f$, set `i` to be the `maximum difference index`, i.e. if there is a jump between two constraints in their number of nonzero entries, stop.
* Set all constraints up until the `maximum difference index` to be master constraints, i.e. at max the first \f$20\%\f$ of the constraints with the highest and similar neighborhood size.
