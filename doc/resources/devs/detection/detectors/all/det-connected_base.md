# Connected Detector (base) {#det-connected_base}

### Overview

| `C` | connectedbase               |   | âœ“ |   |

This detector assigns all constraints and variables to the same block if they are connected,
A constraint and a variable are adjacent if the variable appears in the constraint.

### Algorithmic Details
This detector is only different from "connected_nonewlinkingvars", if the parameter `useconssadj` is true and the function `GCGconshdlrDecompGetConssAdjCalculated(scip)` returns true and the number of linking variables is 0. Else, the `completeByConnected()` function is called, invoking the same procedure as the "connected_nonewlinkingvars" detector.

* If the number of blocks in the given partial decomposition is below 0, set it to 0.
* Create a boolean vector with number of constraints as length. Vector value is true iff the constraint is open.
* While there are open constraints remaining (initialize queue with the first open constraint)
  * add the current constraint to the neighborConss vector
  * Iterate over open constraints that are adjacent to the current one according to the Seeedpool::createConssAdjacency() function
    * if this constraint is not open or in the master constraints or was already visited, continue
    * else add this constraint to the neighborConss vector
  * get neighborVars according to the calculated neighborConss
  * define a new block with the neighborConss and neighborVars
  * remove all neighborConss and neighborVars from the open variables
* assign all remaining variables to block 0, if it exists, and to master otherwise
