This detector calculates cons-cons adjacency (if not already done) and sorts constraints according to the size of their neighborhood. It then searches for two consecutive constraints with largest size difference (according neighborhood size) in the sorted constraints. All constraints having a larger neighborhood than the second one are then assigned to the master.

### Algorithmic Details
* Iterate over all open constraints (\f$N\f$ many)
 * For each constraint, get the neighborhood size (\f$n_{\text{neighborhood}}=\f$`getNConssForCons()`) and make a tuple of the two: \f$(n,c)\f$, with \f$c\f$ the constraint and add it to the list `l`
* Sort the tuples in `l` in ascending order by the first element (the neighborhood, higher means more dense).
* Set the `last index` to be \f$r_{max}*N\f$, with \f$r_{max}\f$ being the parameter `maxratio` (by default \f$0.2\f$)
* Iterate over all constraints
  * If the `last index` (i.e. by default the first \f$20\%\f$ of the constraints, starting with the greatest neighborhood size) is reached, stop.
  * If the difference in neighborhood size between the current item `l[i]` and the next item `l[i+1]` is smaller than the default `maximum difference index`=\f$1\f$, set `i` to be the `maximum difference index`, i.e. if there is a jump between two constraints in their neighborhood size, stop.
* Set all constraints up until the `maximum difference index` to be master constraints, i.e. at max the first \f$20\%\f$ of the constraints with the highest and similar number of nonzeros.
