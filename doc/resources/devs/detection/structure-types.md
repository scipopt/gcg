# Types of Structures GCG can detect
Using different detectors, GCG can find structures in your model. The following structure types are being detected in 
the current release (c.f. GCG_DECTYPE):

- `GCG_DECTYPE_DIAGONAL`: "pure" block diagonal structure (no linking variables and constraints)
- `GCG_DECTYPE_BORDERED`: bordered block diagonal structure (linking constraints only)
- `GCG_DECTYPE_ARROWHEAD`: arrowhead structure (linking variables and constraints)
- `GCG_DECTYPE_STAIRCASE`: staircase structure (linking variables between consecutive blocks)
- `GCG_DECTYPE_UNKNOWN`: unknown structure (used for initialization)

## Pure Block-Diagonal {#block-diagonal}

## Single-Bordered Block-Diagonal {#single-bordered}
In a single-bordered structure, the blocks are either connected by master constraints or by linking variables, but not both.

## Double-Bordered Block-Diagonal (Arrowhead) {#arrowhead}
The arrowhead structure is a double bordered decomposition. It consists of master constraints and linking variables.

## Staircase {#staircase}
So-called staircase structures define decompositions where each block is connected
with the next one via linking variables. This often happens for programs that
possess a time dependency, where one time step influences the following.
