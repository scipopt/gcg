# Getting Started: Developers' Edition {#dev-getting-started}
> With this getting started, we do not want to explain how to use GCG and its features (this was

[TOC]

After a first introduction to development in general and our guidelines for projects, we proceed
to @ref implementation "implementational details of GCG".
GCG is built on top of SCIP and uses SCIP's methods, data structures and interfaces and thus
it is necessary to understand **how SCIP and GCG generally do things**
and secondly, **how GCG communicates with SCIP**.

@todo we should describe how the original problem is reformulated

# Getting Started as a GCG Developer {#new-gcg-dev}
> In this section we describe how even unexperienced software developers can get themselves
> up-and-running in no time with GCG to start developing as seemlessly as possible.
> If you are an experienced developer, you may simply skip to the @ref implementation.

## General Compilation Basics
After installing GCG from Git using the @ref git-install Guide, you will probably start changing code.
To get started, the following hints might help you (if you are using the Makefile build system).

- **Compiling GCG's dependencies** happened with the command
```
make deps
```
executed from within the top directory of your installation folder, where `deps` stands for dependencies.
The process takes about 5-10 minutes depending on your system and generates the binaries and/or libraries
necessary, e.g. SCIP, SoPlex, etc.

- **Compiling GCG itself** happened with the command
```
make
```
executed from within the top directory of your installation folder and used links to all dependencies.
This usually takes about 5-10 minutes depending on your system and generates the GCG binary,
which is located in `bin/` and the reason why we always call GCG using `./bin/gcg`.

- If you **change or add code inside `src/`**, i.e. GCG code, you have to **recompile GCG** using `make`.
This should only recompile the affected files and does not take long (a few seconds).

- If you **change or add code inside `lib/`**, e.g. SCIP code, you have to **recompile the dependencies**
using `make`. This should still only recompile the affected files and does not take long.

- If you **change flags** (e.g. include bliss using the flag `BLISS=true`), it is required to do
this with both commands, i.e. call `make deps BLISS=true` **and** `make BLISS=true`. Not all flags
change things during both compilation runs, but to avoid unnecessary errors, we recommend to have
the flags synchronized at all times. Note that some flags (e.g. `OPT=dbg`) need to recompile all
code (since different binaries are generated), while others do not.

## Starting a new project with GCG
First, please note that
* all information that can be **relevant for all** users of GCG **is located in this documentation**.   
* everything that is **specific to the chair's infrastructure** can be found **in the**
[GCG Manuals and Guides](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Manuals-and-Guides) (inside our Git),

Therefore, if you are developing with access to the Git of GCG, it is an **absolute must** to first go
through the [New Developers Checklist](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Wiki/GCG-Developers-Checklists#new-developers-checklist)
and check out the most important guides in the [GCG Manuals and Guides](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Manuals-and-Guides).

### Initiation Phase
After setting up our [branch and project page (as specified in the Git Workflow)](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Manuals-and-Guides/Git-Instructions-and-Guidelines), for many projects, it has proven useful to start with adding
- an own **user dialog item** to activate feature functionality
- or an own **setting** to activate feature functionality and
- an own **target** for make test
- or an own **settings file** that activates one's feature.

Next, one can start with the development of the feature.

## Development
Before starting with development, it might be useful to read the @ref implementation.
Then, we also generally recommend to take a look at the @ref example-projects, if applicable.
During development, please
- always comply with the [SCIP Coding Style Guidelines](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/CODE.php) and
- check for existing functions before writing own ones to avoid redundancy (also between SCIP and GCG!).

## Testing
We recommend to start testing as soon as the code is able to run to avoid consequential errors.
If developing on our Git, an automated CI pipeline will compile and briefly test your code
upon every push.
Once the new feature is ready to be tested more thoroughly, there are different guides for each step of testing.
Again, there are also pages in the [GCG Git Wiki]((https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Manuals-and-Guides)
that have to be followed to make the tests run inside the chair's infrastructure, so keep that in mind.

To conduct experiments, **we have a guide** on @ref conduct-experiments. Testing in general requires
an @ref git-install "installation with Makefile". After having gathered the files described in
@ref what-files please **follow the next steps** (e.g. @ref compare-settings or @ref compare-code),
which will use @ref visu-suite and its automatic reporting functionality to allow for easy
comparisons.

## Reproducibility
In general, it **should be possible for other researchers to reproduce your results**.
We recommend to always
- give an easy-to-follow **readme** file in markdown format,
- make sure that all the **data is available** in a persistent place for developers to find,
- **do not hard-code any paths**, especially not with your name inside.

# GCG-Specific Implementational Details {#implementation}
In this section, we explain the most important characteristics of SCIP's implementation
and the interplay between GCG and SCIP.

#### Coding Style Guidelines
Both SCIP and GCG (aim to) comply with a **common set of coding style guidelines**.
Those are given by the [SCIP documentation](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/CODE.php).

#### SCIP Stages
At times, **GCG needs to interact with SCIP** directly. This can only be done within the
limits of the current SCIP stage, because the solving process within SCIP is executed in
stages (see Figure 1). For more information, please check the SCIP documentation or the
[SCIP intro presentation](https://www.scipopt.org/workshop2018/SCIP-Intro.pdf).

#### Original and Transformed Problems
> During the solving process, GCG manages **two SCIP instances**, one holding
> the original problem, the other one representing the reformulated problem.

As you read in your instance, it **will be kept in SCIP and GCG as the "original" problem**.
Everything you do to it after reading in is performed on the "transformed" problem
(presolving is applied on the "transformed" one).
The original problem is **used as a safe copy** to check the feasibility of solutions. In particular,
it cannot be manipulated.
GCG is detecting on the transformed (i.e. also presolved) problem (`opt`), but can also detect on the original
(`detect` without `presolve` before it).
It is important to know in which problem you are working (usually always the master, i.e. transformed problem),
especially for SCIP's memory management. If you want to allocate memory in the master problem,
you have to access it "manually". Example:
```
masterscip = GCGgetMasterprob(scip);
SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocBlockMemoryArray(masterscip, &branchruledata->score, branchruledata->maxvars) );
```

#### Mirroring of Branching Decisions to SCIP
> One of the core features of GCG, the generic column generation, leads to the
> fact that GCG sometimes wants to branch differently than SCIP wants to.
> This is why we synchronize the branch-and-bound tree between the underlying
> SCIP instance and GCG, such that SCIP can execute them.

As teased in the previous section, the original instance coordinates the solving process
while the **transformed instance builds the tree in the same way**, transfering branching
decisions and bound changes from the original problem and solving the LP relaxation of the
extended formulation via column generation.

The code for the communication to SCIP during branching on original variables is inside the
cons_masterbranch.c and cons_origbranch.c source files. The process is as follows:
We (since we can make better branching decisions in most cases) branch ourselves
(`cons_masterbranch`) and then mirror those decisions to SCIP (`cons_origbranch`)
where they are reconstructed.

In the case that an aggregation took place, we do not do branching on original variables.
