# Branching Rules {#branching-rules}

# The GCG Branching Rules
Branching Rules describe **how one can branch in a given node** in the Branch-and-Bound tree. For example,
one can branch on constraints or on a set of variables all at once. Adjusting the branching rule according
to your problem will be done automatically by GCG and can significantly influence the runtime required
to solve it.

## List of Branching Rules
We currently offer 3 different branching rules, as well as one empty branching rule to coordinate the
branching process between SCIP and GCG.

- **Vanderbeck Generic Branching** \n
branching rule for original problem in GCG while real branching is in the master 
- **Original Variable Branching** \n
branching rule to branch on integral variables of the original problem which were assigned a fractional solution value
- **Ryan Foster Branching** \n
branching rule for original problem in GCG implementing the Ryan and Foster branching scheme 

Descriptions of those and their code documentation can be
found @ref BRANCHINGRULES-GCG "here".

## Adding own Branching Rules
If you want to **add your own branching rules**, i.e. define exactly how to branch on variables, 
please consider our "How to add" for that.
