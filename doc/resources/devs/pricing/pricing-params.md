# Modifying Parameters of the GCG Pricing
We have around 2000 parameters for the pricing available, so it might be difficult
to choose the right ones for your class of problems. In the following, some hints
about good settings will be given.

### Important Parameters
In this section, we present parameters that are worth trying to change
in some problems. The results are based upon experiments we conducted.

@todo @schilling

### Partial Pricing
In order to make GCG perform partial pricing only, please go into `set pricing` and then enter
the `masterpricer` settings. There, you are able to 
- set the number of columns after which GCG  **stops solving the pricing problem** 
(in reduced cost pricing), either in absolute terms (`maxcolsprobredcost`) or in relative terms 
(`relmaxprobsredcost`).
- set the number of pricing problems that should be called, i.e. **aborting the pricing round** 
(in reduced cost pricing) after a specified number of columns generated (`maxcolsroundredcost`)
- set the **order in which pricing problems are called** in every pricing round (`sorting`)

### Change other Parameters of the Pricing
You can also modify other parameters of the pricing. 
You can set them by entering `set` and then `pricing`. 
In the following, we give a list of all parameters that can then be changed.

# List of Pricing Parameters
A list of detection parameters can also be seen (and searched) when inserting `set pricing` or `set pricingsolver` into the search box on the page of @ref interactive-menu.
