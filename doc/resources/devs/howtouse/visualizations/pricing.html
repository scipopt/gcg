    <h4>Complete Plot</h4>
    <img src="img/visu/pricing/BPPC_1_3_6.default.complete.lines.png" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption style="font-size:small; line-height:1.1">This Plot shows how many variables were generated in a certain pricing round in which time for all nodes of the Branch and Bound tree. The node numbers are shown above the plot and the rounds are in the line below that. Each bar represents the iteration of one pricing problem. Here, only one pricing problem existed, thus there is just one color. Note that the numbers of those pricing problems can have gaps in between, since they could have been aggregated prior to the pricing. Whether those variables are useful is shown by all bars that are below zero, as they mean that the variables of that pricing iteration are in the optimal solution of the Root LP (Root LP Sol) or IP (Incumbent). Finally, the dots show how many columns are taken from the column pool. Note that the shown plot was generated with the <code>--lines 0</code> argument, which means that no lines are printed between pricing rounds.</figcaption>

    <h4>Time Plot</h4>
    <img src="img/visu/pricing/Bs02.default.time.png" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption style="font-size:small; line-height:1.1">The Pricing Time Statistics include four pie charts. The first one shows how much of the runtime was needed in the reduced cost pricing, the master LP and during the initial Farkas. The upper center one shows the relative (and, inside the slices, absolute) time needed by each pricing problem that took at least 11 degree of the pie (the last degree where the absolute numbers inside the slices are still readable). Note that if no absolute numbers are needed, but only the highest possible amount of slices (pricing problems) should be shown, the <code>--short-times</code> argument can be set. The pie chart to the upper right shows how many columns were generated by each pricing problem and the ratio between the upper right and the upper center, i.e. the variables per second, is shown in the lower left, illustrating which pricing problem yielded the most variables for the RMP. Finally, in the course of this thesis, an additional subplot that illustrates the seconds needed by each pricing problem to generate a variable was added.</figcaption>

    <h4>Summary Plot</h4>
    <img src="img/visu/pricing/Bs02.default.summary.png" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption style="font-size:small; line-height:1.1">The summary plot aims to illustrate the same thing as the "complete plot". The end of the root node, which is treated in deeper detail in the Bounds Plot (see Section \ref{sec:bounds}), is marked by a red line. The plot consists of two different $y$-axes, one representing the time (in seconds) needed for the pricing and the other the fraction of pricing problems that generated variables. This leads to the ability to identify pricing rounds that ran for a long time and see when and how many pricing problems were successful. In this given plot, one can see that during the initial Farkas Pricing, nearly all pricing problems generated columns, while in the rest of the time spent in the root node, close to none did. Then, in the rest of the tree for most of the time, below 30% of the pricing problems did not generate any variables.</figcaption>

    <h4>Bubble Plot</h4>
    <img src="img/visu/pricing/Bs02.default.bubble.png" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption style="font-size:small; line-height:1.1">In this visualization, one can see all pricing problems listed vertically along the $y$-axis. Then, in the left subfigure, they are shown against the pricing rounds on the $x$-axis. Every time the pricer yielded at least one variable resulting from a pricing problem, a dot is printed in the round where it was generated. This results in the ability to not only see the sensibility of each pricing problem, but also in which rounds what pricing problem performed best. For example, around the 200th round, only 1 or two pricing problems generated columns, whereas at the end of the Farkas pricing, nearly all generated variables. The subplot on the right-hand side shows how many percent of the variables were generated by which problem.</figcaption>

    <h4>Gap Plot</h4>
    <img src="img/visu/pricing/Bs02.default.gap.png" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption style="font-size:small; line-height:1.1">The gap plot compares the solving time of a pricing problem (of which usually more than one are solved during a pricing round}) with the size of the gap in the root node at that point of time. The gap here is the ratio between the maximum gap (the ratio of the worst, but finite primal bound and the worst, but finite dual bound) and the gap in the root node at the point of time given by the $x$-axis. Here, the pricing problems that ran when most of the gap was closed, solved nearly immediately. Note that it is also possible to show the time of one pricing iteration} instead of one pricing problem, which sums up all points seen here that happened in the same iteration. Note that the data used for the plots in general is only taken once per <code>0.01</code> seconds, which leads to a "discrete" distribution.</figcaption>

    <h4>Depth Plot</h4>
    <img src="img/visu/pricing/Bs02.default.depth.png" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption style="font-size:small; line-height:1.1">This figure illustrates how the gap develops along the depth of the branching tree. Each dot represents the gap as given by the primal and dual bounds in this specific node as given by the GCG "root bounds" table (just like in the bounds plotter). This node is located on the tree depth that can be read on the $x$-axis, such that for each $x$-coordinate, at most $2^x$ points can exist. Furthermore, a plot of the mean is given.</figcaption>

    <h4>Node ID Plot</h4>
    <img src="img/visu/pricing/Bs02.default.nodeID.png" style="width:80%">
    <figcaption style="font-size:small; line-height:1.1">The Node ID plot is similar to the Depth Plot. Instead of the depth in the branch-and-bound tree, we now have the node ID. This leads to the fact that one can see behavior that is not dependent of the depth, but of the time progression during the branching.</figcaption>
