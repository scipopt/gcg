# The GCG Presolving {#presolving}

> The **presolving of a problem** is a very important step in increasing the
> efficiency with which a solver can optimally solve a given instance.
> In the following, we will explain how GCG presolves your instance.

The GCG presolving is a modified version of SCIP's own presolving. We describe the process more thoroughly on
the following page, also hinting at **problems that arise with presolving** when wanting to detect structures afterwards.

If you want to **change parameters** of the GCG presolving, please refer to the following page. We recommend
to first read up about the process (see above) to modify parameters efficiently.
