## Introduction
<img src="1.png" style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 0 0; width: 10%">
**This is Andrew.** He lives near Edinburgh and has just founded his Start-up "Edin-OR" which 
specializes on optimizing planning and decision making processes within companies.
Luckily, he has a friend over at _Royal Mail_, the local postal services company, 
who might help him with getting his first real job, **scheduling the vehicles** that deliver the mail.
Since the management is doubtful of Andrew's capacilities, they ask him to begin with
artificial data that is, however, very close to theirs. As a start, they suggest instances first used by
Christofides et al. \cite u1:christofides1981exact.\n
As always, Andrew starts with the exact problem definition.


## Problem Definition
<img src="fleet.png" style="width:49%">
<img src="electric.png" style="width:49%"><br>
<sub>Sources: motoringresearch.com and electrek.co</sub><br>
The Royal Mail has a fleet consisting of about 50.000 vehicles and a subset of them operates in the
Edinburgh region. Soon getting new, more efficient and environmentally-friendly electric vehicles, 
the local Royal Mail also wants to optimize the routes that they (and older vehicles) drive to deliver mail.

### The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
The goal is to deliver mail to all their customers using a given number of vehicles with limited
capacity each. These will each drive their tour, starting from the depot and returning after their shift (after
having delivered the mail to all recipients). Doing this, they don't have any time constraints, but instead just
the capacity of their own vehicle. This is called the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and has already been
known for quite some time. A standard model is defined as following:
\f{align}{
	\min\quad & \sum_{(i,j) \in E} c_{ij}x_{ij}^{k}\\
	s.t. \quad	& \sum_{(i,j)\in \delta^{+} (i)} x_{ij}^{k}=\sum_{(j,i)\in \delta^{-} (i)} x_{ji}^{k}= 
	    \begin{cases}
	    \begin{aligned}
        1           &\qquad   i=d,\\
        z_{i}^{k}   &\qquad   i\neq d
        \end{aligned}
        \end{cases}
	    \qquad                              && k \in \{1,\dots,K\}\\
	    & \sum_{k\in\{1,\dots,K\}} z_{i}^{k} = 1    && i\in V\\
	    & \sum_{(i,j)\in\delta^+(S)}x_{ij}\geq 1 \qquad && \emptyset \neq S \subsetneq V \\
	    & x_{ij}^{k} \in \{0,1\}              && k\in\{1,\dots,K\},\  (i,j)\in E\\
	    & z_{i}^{k} \in \{0,1\}               && k\in\{1,\dots,K\},\  i\in V\\
  \f}

Andrew tries to choose an instance of medium difficulty to start with, even though they might become much bigger once he gets real data. 
The instance is called `E021-06m`. It features 21 customers to visit and 6 vehicles, each with a capacity of 4000. Note that the model 
by Christofides et al. is not exactly as the one above, since they refined it a bit further (see \cite u1:christofides1981exact for more information).<br>
**Andrew could also specify the problem himself** using e.g. ZIMPL (see @ref u2 "second use case").

## Searching for a Solver
With the problem at hand, Andrew starts searching for solvers of mixed integer programs. He quickly comes
across the most common ones like Gurobi and SCIP. The latter has the advantage, that it is source-open and can
be used **without having to purchase a license**, which is a big advantage because Andrew just wants do to a bit of
testing and furthermore does not have that much capital yet (note that for commercial use of GCG and SCIP, the SCIP team has to be contacted first, since they require a different license). Thus, he tries to solve his instance with SCIP. After more than 
two hours he aborts the solving:
```

```
He thinks that he could do better, since Andrew knows that the problem at hand is a **structured integer program**.
Thus, he starts searching for state-of-the-art methods for solving those. He encounters **many proprietary approaches**, 
where scientists had implemented their own customized solvers for their own vehicle routing and many other problems, 
but since Andrew has not yet gotten the hang of all this "decomposing", "pricing" or "cutting"
and he also wants to **reuse code as efficiently and often as possible**, he starts looking
for _generic_ solvers **that would do all of that automatically for him** and finally finds "Generic Column Generation",
which seems to be fitting. He is happy about the interface of GCG being just like those of all other commonly used
solvers, but since the search for existing approaches had taken him so long, there is not much time left to solve 
the vehicle routing problem the management gave him, so he just goes ahead and @ref easy-install "installs" GCG.

## First Time: Using GCG
After the installation, Andrew **fires up GCG** with a simple

```
./bin/gcg
```
The output he is getting shows him the software versions and some copyright information.
If he were to add more external code, which could improve solving speed, they would appear under "External Codes".
As LP solver, he again can rely on the source-open solver "SoPlex", which, in contrast to "CPLEX" did not cost him
anything. It is part of the whole SCIP Optimization Suite. Finally, he can see that the default settings are being used,
which is fine, since he will not do any fine-tuning.\n

To continue, Andrew now wants to **read in his problem**. This can be done with a simple `read` and then the problem file.
GCG will signalize that the problem was read successfully and already give some statistics: `E021-06m` only contains a
few continuous variables and quite some integer variables and 2600 inequalities that are constraining the problem.
```

Finally, after looking at the @ref getting-started Guide in GCG's documentation, he proceeds with **optimizing his problem**.

```
Having already worked with mixed integer programming solvers before, Andrew sees that there are many similarities to them. **The optimal solution
can be read at the bottom** ("Primal Bound"), along with the time needed to solve it. If Andrew aborted before GCG was able to find an optimal
solution, he would still be able to see the two bounds:
```
SCIP Status        : solving was interrupted
Solving Time (sec) : 8.23
Solving Nodes      : 1
Primal Bound       : +4.30884678000000e+02 (2 solutions)
Dual Bound         : +4.18548834278730e+02
Gap                : 2.95 %
```
And would know that the objective function value of the optimal solution lies somewhere between 419 and 430. This result, which was obtained
in just a few seconds, is already stronger than the two bounds that a non BP&C solver like SCIP calculated in over 2 hours (see above).

## Understanding the Output
**For many, this is not very relevant** (they can **just skip to the section** @ref get-solution), but since Andrew wants to understand what is 
happening (at least someday), he takes a brief look at what was printed there. Before GCG starts with the "real" solving process 
(the Branch and Price and Cutting), there are a few steps that are executed and that distinguish GCG from other solvers. 

### Presolving
> More details and the corresponding theory and implementation can be found on the page @ref presolving.

During the presolving, trivially fulfilled or unsatisfied constraints are indentified as well as redundant variables and more. 
It can happen that a problem is already solved after presolving. The full log of a presolving process looks as following:
```
presolving:
(round 1, fast)       0 del vars, 120 del conss, 0 add conss, 120 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 6 chg coeffs, 0 upgd conss, 0 impls, 314 clqs
(round 2, exhaustive) 0 del vars, 120 del conss, 0 add conss, 120 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 6 chg coeffs, 284 upgd conss, 0 impls, 314 clqs
(round 3, medium)     0 del vars, 126 del conss, 114 add conss, 120 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 6 chg coeffs, 284 upgd conss, 0 impls, 440 clqs
(round 4, exhaustive) 26 del vars, 126 del conss, 114 add conss, 120 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 12 chg coeffs, 284 upgd conss, 0 impls, 6230 clqs
(round 5, exhaustive) 62 del vars, 126 del conss, 114 add conss, 120 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 12 chg coeffs, 284 upgd conss, 0 impls, 9622 clqs
   (0.5s) probing: 1000/2646 (37.8%) - 84 fixings, 0 aggregations, 356518 implications, 0 bound changes
   (0.6s) probing: 1190/2646 (45.0%) - 84 fixings, 0 aggregations, 451993 implications, 0 bound changes
   (0.6s) probing aborted: 1000/1000 successive useless probings
(round 6, exhaustive) 84 del vars, 126 del conss, 114 add conss, 120 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 12 chg coeffs, 284 upgd conss, 1490 impls, 9793 clqs
   (0.7s) probing: 1290/2646 (48.8%) - 84 fixings, 0 aggregations, 503003 implications, 0 bound changes
   (0.7s) probing aborted: 1000/1000 successive useless probings
presolving (7 rounds: 7 fast, 6 medium, 5 exhaustive):
 84 deleted vars, 126 deleted constraints, 114 added constraints, 120 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 12 changed coefficients
 1690 implications, 9995 cliques
presolved problem has 2682 variables (2562 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 120 cont) and 2588 constraints
      6 constraints of type <knapsack>
    386 constraints of type <setppc>
   2196 constraints of type <linear>
Presolving Time: 0.70
```
Andrew easily identifies that the presolving happens in rounds (1-7), where each round has different settings and different outcomes.
Most importantly, in the line 
```
presolving (7 rounds: 7 fast, 6 medium, 5 exhaustive):
 84 deleted vars, 126 deleted constraints, 114 added constraints, 120 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 12 changed coefficients
```
he can see how variables and constraints were deleted and thus do not need to be respected anymore and the "bounds were tightened", meaning that
these minor changes to his instance lead to a potentially faster solving of his problem.

### Detection
> More details and the corresponding theory and implementation can be found on the page @ref detection.

During the detection, one of GCG's main features, the solver will **find** @ref structure-types "different structures" **in your instance** and 
will then "decompose" the problem such that it can be reformulated (see next section).

```
 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 6  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 4 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 5 different constraint classes

Detection Time: 0.26
```

### Reformulation
> More details and the corresponding theory and implementation can be found on the page @ref pricing.
After decomposing the problem, GCG will apply a Dantzig-Wolfe (default) or Benders reformulation to the problem. With that
formulation, the problem can in some cases be solved far more efficiently using Column Generation.
```
A Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is applied to solve the original problem.
Chosen structure has 6 blocks and 20 linking constraints.
This decomposition has a maxwhite score of 0.826893.
Warning: Discretization with continuous variables is only an experimental feature.
Master problem is a set partitioning problem.
Matrix has 6 blocks, using 1 aggregated pricing problem.
```

### Branch-and-Price-and-Cut
> More details and the corresponding theory and implementation can be found on the page @ref pricing.
As a BP&C solver, GCG will apply Column Generation and apply cuts in every node of the branch-and-bound tree. Concerning the log,
this is the part that Andrew already knows quite well. While most columns are not that important to him yet, there is one that
is particularly, and that is the gap. It tells him **how close GCG currently is** to the optimal solution. It can also be read
at the "dualbound" and "primalbound" columns.
```

```

## Getting the Solution {#get-solution}
Apart from the optimal objective function value, Andrew also wants to see which vehicle is routed where. To do this, he can
simply (after having solved the problem) type `display solution` and will be able to see what values each variable has
in the optimal solution.
```
objective value:                           430.884678
x#1#3#1                                             1 	(obj:8.062258)
x#1#6#2                                             1 	(obj:24.738634)
x#1#8#3                                             1 	(obj:17.262677)
...
```
Depending on the definition of the model, this can have different meanings, but here, the most intuitive applies: if `x#1#3#1` is
1, then \f$x^1_{31}=1\f$, i.e. vehicle \f$1\f$ drives from customer \f$3\f$ to customer \f$1\f$. Since driving there is not free,
this comes at a cost of about 8.06 units for the objective function value.

## Disclaimer
With this (not even that simple!) VRP instance, we were quite fortunate. SCIP does not seem to solve in reasonable time at all, and even commercial solvers such as gurobi are not faster than GCG. However, **this is not always the case**. It can happen that GCG performs significantly slower than other solvers not using Branch-and-Price. Thus, the main takeaway should be that you should **always try column generation**, since it can in many cases still be very beneficial to your solving performance. If you want to understand what the main factor of success of Branch-and-Price is, you should check out the page on @ref pricing-solvers.
