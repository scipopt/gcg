#### The Problem ####

We consider a variant of a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problem. Given an undirected graph \f$G=(V,E)\f$, a *dominating set*
\f$S\subseteq V\f$ is a subset of the vertices, such that every vertex
\f$i \in V\f$ is in \f$S\f$ or adjacent to a vertex in \f$S\f$. We say
that every vertex not in \f$S\f$ is *dominated* by a vertex in
\f$S\f$. For the *capacitated dominating set problem* we are
additionally given vertex weights \f$u:V\rightarrow
\mathbb{Z}_+\f$. Loosely speaking, every vertex \f$i \in V\f$ can
dominate at most \f$u(i)\f$ many other vertices. More formally, a
subset \f$S\subseteq V\f$ is a capacitated dominating set if and only
if there exists a mapping \f$f:V\setminus S\rightarrow S\f$ such that
the number of vertices mapped under \f$f\f$ to \f$i\in S\f$ is no more
than \f$u(i)\f$.



The following example graph is taken from \cite gcg:PotluriSingh:2012.
All vertices have capacity 2, and a minimum capacitated dominated set
consists of e.g., \f$S=\{2,6,7,8,12\}\f$. An arc \f$(i,j)\f$ is
interpreted as ''\f$i\f$ is dominated by \f$j\f$,'' representing a
possible mapping \f$f\f$.

#### A ''Textbook'' Binary Program ####

The following intuitive model was presented in \cite gcg:Li-etal:2018
(actually, we corrected it a bit). We use variables
\f$x_i\in\{0,1\}\f$, \f$i\in V\f$, to represent whether \f$i\in S\f$,
i.e., it is in the dominating set or not. The mapping \f$f\f$ is
represented by variables \f$y_{ij}\in\{0,1\}\f$, \f$\{i,j\}\in E\f$,
that we interpret as \f$y_{ij}=1 \iff f(j)=i\f$, that is, when \f$i\f$
dominates \f$i\f$. Define \f$N(i):=\{j\in V : \{i,j\}\in E\}\f$
as the *open neighborhood* of \f$i\in V\f$.


\f{align}{
  & \text{min}
  & & \sum_{i\in V}x_i \\
  & \text{s.t.} & & \sum_{j\in N(i)} y_{ji}  + x_i \geq 1 && i\in V \tag{BP} \\
  & & & \sum_{j\in N(i)} y_{ij} \leq u_i x_i && i\in V \\
  & & & x_i\in\{0,1\} && i\in V \\
  & & & y_{ij}\in\{0,1\} && \{i,j\}\in E
  \f}

The objective function minimizes \f$|S|\f$. Every vertex has to be dominated
by a neighbor or is itself in \f$S\f$; and no vertex can dominate more
vertices than given by its capacity (the capacity is available only if
the vertex is in \f$S\f$). Thus, the capacity constraints also link
the \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$ variables.

A \ZIMPL model file ([download](potluri+singh.zpl)) for the above instance is as follows:

```
# vertices
set V := {1 .. 14};
# (undirected) edges
set E := {<1,2>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,6>, <3,8>, <7,8>, <5,6>, <6,9>, <6,10>, <6,11>, <7,11>, <7,12>, <7,13>, <7,14>, <10,12>, <11,12>};
# (directed) arcs, produced from (undirected) edges
set A := E union {<j,i> in V*V with <i,j> in E};

# uniform capacity of 2 for each vertex
param cap[<v> in V] := 2;

# neighbors of v
defset N(v) := {<i> in V with <v,i> in A};


# is v selected in the dominating set?
var x[V] binary;

# for <i,j> in A: is j dominated by i?
var y[A] binary;


minimize cost: sum<v> in V: x[v];

# every vertex v must be dominated by some vertex i (unless v is selected)
subto dominate:
	forall <v> in V: sum<i> in N(v): y[i,v] + x[v] >= 1;

# the domination capacity of each vertex must be respected
subto capacity:
	forall <v> in V: sum<i> in N(v): y[v,i] <= x[v]*cap[v];

```    



\n Of course, you can use any modeling language you like, or generate
your model (typically in `.lp` or `.mps` format) using a script. A
bonus from using \ZIMPL is that \GCG can directly read the model file
(when you compiled it with ``ZIMPL=true``). So, we start \GCG and


```
GCG> read potluri+singh.zpl

...

original problem has 46 variables (46 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 28 constraints
GCG>

```

\n If \GCG complains about a missing reader (because you compiled it
with ``ZIMPL=false``), alternatively run \ZIMPL on the ``.zpl`` file
to generate an ``.lp`` or ``.mps``, and read this into \GCG. Then start
the optimization.


```
GCG> optimize

...

A Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is applied to solve the original problem.

\n This instance is too easy, so not much happens in \GCG (in particular no branching).
But when we try a larger instance (like [this one](uni-UDG-5-250-150-graphS0N250.mps.gz)
with 250 vertices, 3780 edges, and uniform capacities of 5 for each vertex;
taken from \cite gcg:PotluriSingh:2012),

\GCG applied a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of the (''original'') input
model to obtain an equivalent (''master'') integer program. The
latter is solved by branch-and-price, that is, the linear relaxation
in each node of the branch-and-bound tree is solved by column
generation. \GCG automatically detects what subproblems to form from
the original problem.

#### A Binary Program Based on Subsets of Vertices ####

In the compact model, the \f$y\f$-variables represent subsets \f$T_i
:= \{j \in V : y_{ij}=1\} \subseteq N(i)\f$ of neighbors, for each
vertex \f$i\in V\f$.  The important observation is that an (optimal)
solution \f$S\f$ to the capacitated dominated set problem corresponds
to a partition of the vertices into (a minimum number of) subsets
\f$T_i \cup \{i\}\f$, one for each vertex \f$i\in S\f$.  The color
classes in the figure above exactly reflect these vertex subsets.

We base an alternative model on this observation:  Introduce a binary
variable \f$\lambda^i_T\in\{0,1\}\f$ for *each possible* subset
\f$T\subseteq N(i) \cup \{i\}\f$ of neighbors of \f$i\in V\f$ (and
\f$i\f$ itself), where we require \f$i\in T\f$ and \f$|T|\leq
u_i+1\f$.  Denote by \f${\cal T}_i\f$ the collection of all such vertex
subsets for \f$i\in V\f$. We then state a *set partitioning* model:

\f{align}{
  & \text{min}
  & & \sum_{i\in V}\sum_{T \in {\cal T}_i} \lambda^i_T \\

The objective is to miminimize the cardinality of the partition. Each
vertex must appear in exactly one selected vertex subset and no more
than one subset can be selected per vertex (could be none). In
brackets, we indicate the dual variables per constraint. The
cardinality of \f${\cal T}_i\f$ is \f$|N(i)| \choose u_i\f$, which in
general can be exponential in \f$|V|\f$. This suggests to solve the
linear relaxation by column generation. The *restricted master
problem (RMP)* contains only a (small) subset \f${\cal T}'_i \subseteq
{\cal T}_i\f$ for each \f$i\in V\f$, initially, say, \f${\cal
T}'_i=\{\{i\}\}\f$. This initialization corresponds to the worst
possible solution that *every* vertex is in the dominating set, but
technically, this ensures feasibility of the RMP.

In order to determine a \f$\lambda^i_T\f$ variable with \f$T\in {\cal
T}_i \setminus {\cal T}'_i\f$ of negative reduced cost (or to prove
that none exists), we solve a pricing problem for each \f$i\in
V\f$. It reads as


\f{align}{
  z := \enspace & \text{min}
  & & 1 - \sum_{j\in N(i)} \alpha_j y_j - \alpha_i - \beta_i\\
  & \text{s.t.} & & \sum_{j\in N(i)} y_j \leq u_i   \tag{PP} \\
  & & & y_j\in\{0,1\} &&  j\in V
  \f}

Note again that in this model, \f$i\in V\f$ is fixed. As a solution, a
capacitated subset \f$T=\{j\in N(i) : y_j=1\} \cup \{i\}\f$ of
neighbors of \f$i\in V\f$ (and \f$i\f$ itself) is selected. The
objective function minimizes the reduced cost of the corresponding
\f$\lambda\f$-variable (assuming again that \f$i\in T\f$).

When \f$z<0\f$, variable \f$\lambda^i_T\f$ is added to the RMP; the
RMP is re-optimized, new dual variable values are obtained, and the
process iterates. Otherwise, i.e., \f$z\geq0\f$, we have proven
optimality of the the linear relaxation of the master problem, and we
can branch. As the master problem is a set partitioning problem,
*Ryan-Foster branching* \cite gup:RyanFoster:81 is a good choice.


#### Dantzig-Wolfe Reformulation ####




# work in progress below this point #

Actually, this alternative model results from a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of the compact model.



\GCG by default does not make use of the row and column names, but it can be told to do so:

```
GCG> set detection consclassifier consnamenonumbers origenabled TRUE
```

If you are interested, Potluri and Singh \cite gcg:PotluriSingh:2012 made all their instances [publicly available for download](http://scis.uohyd.ac.in/~apcs/capmds/), together with the `C` code for their heuristics. We provide \ZIMPL model files that read their input, for [uniform](CDS_uni.zpl) and [variable](todo) capacities.

The authors .. provide the data they used in their publication [here] and a general \ZIMPL that can read their instances as input is [here (local ressource)].





**old**

We would like to answer two questions:

1. What exactly happened? (alternative model and Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation)

2. Is it worth it? (is this faster than \SCIP?)



was it worth it?

compare \SCIP on the original model, \GCG with our selected decomposition, and \GCG automatic detection. performance profiles.
