# Improve Decomposition using Expert Knowledge

> <img src="expert.png" style="height:42px; vertical-align:middle; float: left; padding-right:10px;">
> In this use case, we elaborate on different methods to change detection behavior such as
> deactivating detectors, compiling with detectors or changing other settings to **improve
> decomposition quality** and accelerate solving speeds.

The exact different goals are to learn about
 * Deactivating/deprioritizing unpromising detectors (see @ref detection-params)
 * Including promising detectors that were not included in the compile (see @ref detectors "arrowhead/clustering/symmetry detectors")
 * Changing other settings and disabling (or not using) presolving before detecting (see @ref detection-params)


# Modifying Detection Parameters
# Giving decomposition files
> Please consider reading the guide on @ref detection-process to understand where and how your decomposition will be used.

<!--
## Goals of this Guide
#### Format Requirements
- ...

#### Content Requirements (takeaways)  

- decompositions can be **modified**
- **unfitting scores** can lead to choosing bad decompositions

#### Content Requirements (explanations)
- how to detect (on presolved and unpresolved) (`detect`, `presolve detect`, `detect presolve detect`)
  - explain the **translation** (close to the example if possible)
