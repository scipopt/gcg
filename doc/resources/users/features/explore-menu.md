# The Explore Menu {#explore-menu}
> The explore menu is a **submenu** in the interactive console.
> You can leave submenus (e.g. `<explore>` or `<master>`) with `quit`.

# Using the explore menu
## Enter the explore menu
First, you have to `read` and `optimize`, or at least `detect` your problem. Then, like with all commands, just type `explore` in the interactive shell. GCG will show
an overview of all found decompositions:
```

Please enter command or decomposition id to select (or "h" for help) :
```
In this table you can find very useful information about the decomposition GCG found
for your problem. For example, the column `history` contains the sequence of detectors
in the order that they worked on your problem. What exactly the letters mean can
be found @subpage detectors-overview "here".
When typing `h`, you will get a list of possible commands:
```
GCG/explore> help

### Select structures for solving with `select`
You can choose one of the decompositions to
be used for solving with the `select <id>` command.
```
GCG/explore> select 2
==================================================================================
Please specify the nr of the decomposition to be selected:

Please enter command or decomposition id to select (or "h" for help) :

```
After that, you can visualize (see below) the decomposition or also leave the
explore menu (`..`) and optimize the problem. If you don't select a decomposition,
GCG will always use the 'best' one, i.e. nr. 0 in the example above.

### Visualize your decomposition with `visualize`
With the `visualize` command, you can export a visualization of the selected
decomposition. Prior to that, you will have to install "gnuplot" by typing
`sudo apt-get install gnuplot` into your console.

### Use a different score with `score` {#explore-score}
By default, GCG uses the so-called max white score. This means that the decomposition with the most zero entries is used. Since this might not always be the best measure, it is possible to choose a different score:
```
GCG/explore> score
==================================================================================
Please specify the new score:
0: max white,
1: border area,
2: classic,
3: max foreseeing white,
4: ppc-max-white,
5: max foreseeing white with aggregation info,
6: ppc-max-white with aggregation info,
7: experimental benders score
8: strong decomposition score
Note: Sets the detection/scoretype parameter to the given score.
```

### Solve again with a different decomposition with `free`
If you now want to solve your problem with a different decomposition, you first have to
clear the problem from GCG's memory with `free`. Then, read it in again and you are ready to select a different decomposition.
