# How to use this Documentation {#MANUAL}
# How to use this Documentation
**This guide helps you in getting started with GCG** and in particular with the manual
we provide with it. This documentation does not only contain the C-API and thus the
**documented code** in pretty HTML-format but much more. We explain core functionalities
of GCG in a very detailed way and provide you with **guides and instructions** on how
to do things that you might need to do for your own projects. However, not all of these
guides are relevant for everyone.

## Target Groups
While browsing in our documentation, you will frequently encounter these symbols:\n\n

\image html groups1.png "Target Groups for Guides (with ascending depth of content/difficulty level)" width=40%

\n
These **indicate which group of users of GCG we are targeting with this specific guide**, 
facilitating the search for guides and preparing you for their level of "difficulty". 
For example, if you are completely new to the entire field, a target group symbol that
is more to the right (e.g. a scientist) could be a warning for you that this guide might
not be the one for you.

## Where to begin?
### Installation
In any case, you will have to start with the installation. To make this as seemless as possible for you, we prepared different
guides, based on user types. There, you will also already get an idea on how to continue. \n
â‡¨ @ref install "Install GCG now!"

### Using GCG and developing with GCG
Depending on what type of user you are, you might go a different way, but these are the most common ones.
1. Always start with the @ref getting-started guide.
2. Then, if you want to use some of the cool features of GCG, dive into the **first few** @ref use-cases of the @ref users.
3. After that, you might want to take a look at the **more complicated** @ref use-cases, for example by @ref u5.
4. Finally, you can start **developing your own plug-ins** for GCG, starting with the final use case @ref u7 and the @ref example-projects.

# Structure of this Documentation
The GCG documentation and manual is structured into two guides, a misc section
with everything that does not belong into these guides and the C-API.
