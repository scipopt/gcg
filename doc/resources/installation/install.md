# Installation {#install}

## Welcome to GCG!
In the following, we want to show you how to install GCG on your **Linux or Mac** computer.\n
Note that **GCG cannot be installed on Windows out of the box**. If you only have a Windows computer, please see @ref windows-install "Windows Installation Guide" for more information.  \n

> To get started with developing or contributing to the core of GCG, check out the [GCG Developers Checklist](https://git.or.rwth-aachen.de/gcg/gcg/-/wikis/GCG-Wiki/GCG-Developers-Checklists) in our Git Wiki first and go through all points mentioned there.
> Then, the most important guides are probably the ones on @ref howtoadd "adding components" and @ref testing "experimenting".

If you need to install GCG using arguments, for example if you want to enable parallelization, you can find them under @ref makefiles-args and @ref cmake-args respectively. Finally, you should also check out our @ref compatibility and @ref known-bugs.
