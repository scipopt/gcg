In the following, we want to show you how to install GCG on your **Linux or Mac** computer.\n
Note that **GCG cannot be installed on Windows out of the box**. If you only have a Windows computer, please see @ref windows-install "Windows Installation Guide" for more information.  \n

> Importantly, please go through the @ref dev-getting-started. Often, you will need the guides on @ref howtoadd "adding components" and @ref testing "experimenting".
