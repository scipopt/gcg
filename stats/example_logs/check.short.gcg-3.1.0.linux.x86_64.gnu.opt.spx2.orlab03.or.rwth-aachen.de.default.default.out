============

just read dec file:
 added complete decomp for original problem with 5 blocks and 17 masterconss, 0 linkingvars, 3 mastervars, and max white score of   0.729524 
original problem has 128 variables (75 bin, 25 int, 0 impl, 28 cont) and 182 constraints
GCG> optimize

there is an original decomposition and problem is not presolved yet -> disable presolving and start optimizing (rerun with presolve command before detect command for detecting in presolved problem)  
presolving:
presolving (0 rounds: 0 fast, 0 medium, 0 exhaustive):
 0 deleted vars, 0 deleted constraints, 0 added constraints, 0 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 0 cliques
presolved problem has 128 variables (75 bin, 25 int, 0 impl, 28 cont) and 182 constraints
    182 constraints of type <linear>
transformed objective value is always integral (scale: 1)
Presolving Time: 0.00
 calculated translation; number of missing constraints: 0; number of other partialdecs: 1 
Preexisting decomposition found. Solution process started...

A Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is applied to solve the original problem.
Chosen structure has 5 blocks, 3 master-only (static) variables, and 17 linking constraints.
This decomposition has a maxwhite score of 0.729524.
Warning: Discretization with continuous variables is only an experimental feature.
Matrix has 5 blocks, using 5 pricing problems.

there is an original decomposition and problem is not presolved yet -> disable presolving and start optimizing (rerun with presolve command before detect command for detecting in presolved problem)  
presolving:
presolving (0 rounds: 0 fast, 0 medium, 0 exhaustive):
 0 deleted vars, 0 deleted constraints, 0 added constraints, 0 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 0 cliques
presolved problem has 2550 variables (2550 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 100 constraints
    100 constraints of type <linear>
transformed objective value is always integral (scale: 1)

GCG> optimize

there is an original decomposition and problem is not presolved yet -> disable presolving and start optimizing (rerun with presolve command before detect command for detecting in presolved problem)  
presolving:
presolving (0 rounds: 0 fast, 0 medium, 0 exhaustive):
 0 deleted vars, 0 deleted constraints, 0 added constraints, 0 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 0 cliques
presolved problem has 1224 variables (1224 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 74 constraints
     74 constraints of type <linear>
transformed objective value is always integral (scale: 1)
Presolving Time: 0.00
 calculated translation; number of missing constraints: 0; number of other partialdecs: 1 
Preexisting decomposition found. Solution process started...

 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 2  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 3 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 3 different constraint classes 
 Conspartition "constypes according to miplib" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "constypes" conspartition
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 113 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 2 different variable classes
 the current varclass distribution includes 113 classes but only 18 are allowed for GCGconshdlrDecompCalcCandidatesNBlocks()

GCG> optimize

there is an original decomposition and problem is not presolved yet -> disable presolving and start optimizing (rerun with presolve command before detect command for detecting in presolved problem)  
presolving:
presolving (0 rounds: 0 fast, 0 medium, 0 exhaustive):
 0 deleted vars, 0 deleted constraints, 0 added constraints, 0 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 0 cliques
presolved problem has 220 variables (20 bin, 200 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 30 constraints
     30 constraints of type <linear>
transformed objective value is always integral (scale: 1)
Presolving Time: 0.00
 calculated translation; number of missing constraints: 0; number of other partialdecs: 1 
Preexisting decomposition found. Solution process started...

A Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is applied to solve the original problem.
Chosen structure has 20 blocks and 10 linking constraints.
This decomposition has a maxwhite score of 0.633333.
Matrix has 20 blocks, using 1 aggregated pricing problem.

GCG> optimize

presolving:
(round 1, exhaustive) 0 del vars, 0 del conss, 0 add conss, 0 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 0 chg coeffs, 35 upgd conss, 0 impls, 30 clqs
   (0.0s) probing: 51/150 (34.0%) - 0 fixings, 0 aggregations, 0 implications, 0 bound changes
   (0.0s) probing aborted: 50/50 successive totally useless probings
presolving (2 rounds: 2 fast, 2 medium, 2 exhaustive):
 0 deleted vars, 0 deleted constraints, 0 added constraints, 0 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 30 cliques
presolved problem has 150 variables (150 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 35 constraints
      5 constraints of type <knapsack>
     30 constraints of type <setppc>
transformed objective value is always integral (scale: 1)
Presolving Time: 0.01
 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 2  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 2 different constraint classes 
 Conspartition "constypes" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "nonzeros" conspartition
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 2 different constraint classes 
 Conspartition "constypes according to miplib" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "nonzeros" conspartition
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 16 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varpartition "varobjvalsigns" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "vartypes"
 Added reduced version of varpartition varobjvals with 9 different variable classes
 in dec_consclass: there are 1 different constraint classes   
  the current constraint classifier "nonzeros" consists of 2 different classes   
 dec_consclass found 3 new partialdecs 
dec_densemasterconss found 1 new partialdec 
dec_neighborhoodmaster found 1 new partialdec 
 the current varclass distribution includes 16 classes but only 9 are allowed for propagatePartialdec() of var class detector
POSTPROCESSING of decompositions. Added 0 new decomps. 
Found 515 finished decompositions.
Measured running time per detector:
Detector consclass                 worked on        3 finished decompositions and took a total time of      0.000
Detector connectedbase             worked on      514 finished decompositions and took a total time of      0.010
Detector varclass                  worked on      511 finished decompositions and took a total time of      0.010
Detection Time: 0.06

A Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is applied to solve the original problem.
Chosen structure has 5 blocks and 30 linking constraints.
This decomposition has a maxwhite score of 0.114286.
Master problem is a set partitioning problem.
Matrix has 5 blocks, using 5 pricing problems.

 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 13  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 2 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 3 different constraint classes 
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 13 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varpartition "varobjvalsigns" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "vartypes"
 Added reduced version of conspartition nonzeros with 9  different constraint classes 
 Added reduced version of varpartition varobjvals with 9 different variable classes
 in dec_consclass: there are 4 different constraint classes   
  the current consclass distribution includes 13 classes but only 9 are allowed for propagatePartialdec() of cons class detector
 the current constraint classifier "constypes" consists of 2 different classes   
  the current constraint classifier "constypes according to miplib" consists of 3 different classes   
  the current constraint classifier "nonzeros-red-to-9" consists of 9 different classes
