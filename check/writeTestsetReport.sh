#
# This script generates a PDF with visualizations that compare two test runs
# that have been carried out using GCG's make test. It is called by the 
# Makefile, if make is executed with target "visu" and the data directory 
# contains a single run or the user chooses a single one.
# Alternatively, it is called via the check.sh script if make test
# is called with VISU=true.
#
# Common input arguments
# 1. file containing settings for this script (e.g. which visu to generate)
# 2-8. Test run statistics
#
# Additional input arguments from Makefile (if called via make visu)
# 9. Data directory
#
# Additional input arguments from check.sh (if called via make test VISU=true)
# 9.  path .out-file (dir and name), relative from inside check/
# 10. path to .res-file (dir and name), relative from inside check/
# 11. path to vbc dir, relative from inside check/
# 12-15. names and limits, given automatically by make test, calculated from runtime data in make visu

DEBUG="false" # enable extended logging for this script.

# define descriptions for each visualization (deactivate automatic line breaks in your IDE for improved readibility)
declare -A desc_inst
desc_inst["bounds-time"]="The top subplot shows the development of the primal and dual bounds in the RMP during the pricing in the root node as given by the table ``root bounds'' printed by GCG. Every change represents a pricing iteration and the resulting changes to the bounds. The bounds are complemented by a newly created gap plot, which will be explained in Section {sec:tgpp}. The other two subplots illustrate the point in time in the pricing at which the columns that are finally in the basis are generated."
desc_inst["bounds-iter"]="The same plot as the bounds time plot (see below), but with pricing iterations in the root node instead of the time spent there on the \$x\$-axis."
desc_inst["tree-bar"]="This plot shows the percentage of nodes in the Branch-and-Bound tree opened on each level against how many exist on this level (\$2^x\$)."
desc_inst["tree-plot"]="This plot shows the distribution of nodes in the Branch-and-Bound tree opened in absolute terms."
desc_inst["pricing-complete"]="This Plot shows how many variables were generated in a certain pricing round in which time for all nodes of the Branch and Bound tree. The node numbers are shown above the plot and the rounds are in the line below that. Each bar represents the iteration of one pricing problem. Note that the numbers of the pricing problems can have gaps in between, since they could have been aggregated prior to the pricing. Whether those variables are useful is shown by all bars that are below zero, as they mean that the variables of that pricing iteration are in the optimal solution of the Root LP (Root LP Sol) or IP (Incumbent). Finally, the dots show how many columns are taken from the column pool."
desc_inst["pricing-time"]="The Pricing Time Statistics include four pie charts. The first one shows how much of the runtime was needed in the reduced cost pricing, the master LP and during the initial Farkas. The upper center one shows the relative (and, inside the slices, absolute) time needed by each pricing problem that took at least \$\frac{11}{360}\$ of the total pricing time (\$11^{\circ}\$ of the pie, the last degree where the absolute numbers inside the slices are still readable). Note that if no absolute numbers are needed, but only the highest possible amount of slices (pricing problems) should be shown, the \texttt{-{}-short-times} argument can be set. The pie chart to the upper right shows how many columns were generated by each pricing problem and the ratio between the upper right and the upper center, i.e. the variables per second, is shown in the lower left, illustrating which pricing problem yielded the most variables for the RMP. Finally, in the course of this thesis, an additional subplot that illustrates the seconds needed by each pricing problem to generate a variable was added."
desc_inst["pricing-summary"]="The summary plot aims to illustrate the same thing as the ``complete plot''. The end of the root node, which is treated in deeper detail in the Bounds Plot, is marked by a red line. The plot consists of two different \$y\$-axes, one representing the time (in seconds) needed for the pricing and the other the fraction of pricing problems that generated variables. This leads to the ability to identify pricing rounds that ran for a long time and see when and how many pricing problems were successful."
desc_inst["pricing-bubble"]="In this visualization, one can see all pricing problems listed vertically along the \$y\$-axis. Then, in the left subfigure, they are shown against the pricing rounds on the \$x\$-axis. Every time the pricer yielded at least one variable resulting from a pricing problem, a dot is printed in the round where it was generated. This results in the ability to not only see the sensibility of each pricing problem, but also in which rounds what pricing problem performed best. The subplot on the right-hand side shows how many percent of the variables were generated by which problem."
desc_inst["pricing-gap"]="The gap plot compares the solving time of a pricing problem (of which usually more than one are solved during a pricing \textit{round}) with the size of the gap in the root node at that point of time. The gap here is the ratio between the maximum gap (the ratio of the worst, but finite primal bound and the worst, but finite dual bound) and the gap in the root node at the point of time given by the \$x\$-axis. Note that it is also possible to show the time of one pricing \textit{iteration} instead of one pricing \textit{problem}, which sums up all points seen here that happened in the same iteration. Note that the data used for the plots in general is only taken once per \$0.01\$ seconds, which leads to a ``discrete'' distribution."
desc_inst["pricing-depth"]="This figure illustrates how the gap develops along the depth of the branching tree. Each dot represents the gap as given by the primal and dual bounds in this specific node as given by the GCG ``root bounds'' table (just like in the bounds plotter). This node is located on the tree depth that can be read on the \$x\$-axis, such that for each \$x\$-coordinate, at most \$2^x\$ points can exist. Furthermore, a plot of the mean is given."
desc_inst["pricing-nodeID"]="The Node ID plot is similar to the Depth Plot. Instead of the depth in the branch-and-bound tree, we now have the node ID. This leads to the fact that one can see behavior that is not dependent of the depth, but of the time progression during the branching."

declare -A desc_agg
desc_agg["detection-times"]="This plot visualizes what fraction of instances against the time used for the whole detection process, including classification and score computation, on a logarithmic scale."
desc_agg["detection-decomps"]="The above plot shows the number of decompositions that were found for what fraction of instances in the given test set on a logarithmic scale. Only those decompositions are shown that have a score that is strictly greater than \$0\$."
desc_agg["detection-quality"]="This plot illustrates the detection goodness of the test set (according to the ``max white score''). If for all instances in the test set, the best (``whitest'') decomposition was completely white, this plot would show a line with \$y=1\$ for all \$x\$."
desc_agg["detection-quality_custom"]="Similarly to the previous plot, this one shows the detection goodness of the whole test set, but for a specific detector, the ``$CUSTOMDETECTOR'' detector. For this specific detector, GCG outputs the scores separately in the \texttt{detectionstatistics} test mode. With this plot, together with the previous one, one can compare the performance of the Set Partitioning Master detector with the overall performance."
desc_agg["detection-nBlocksOfBest"]="This plot shows how many blocks are used in the (according to the max white score) best decomposition, allowing to make statements about the sensibility of different numbers of blocks."
desc_agg["detection-classification_classes_custom"]="With this visualization, one can see how many classes a classifier determined for the variables. It can be chosen for which classifier to plot this, here ``$CUSTOMCLASSIFIER'' was chosen."
desc_agg["timedist-plot"]="A simple plot of normalized times used for each instance of the testset."
desc_agg["timedist-bar"]="A stacked bar chart of the normalized time distribution of all instances in the test set."
desc_agg["timedist-pie"]="An averaged pie chart for the whole testset."
desc_agg["timedist-grouped_bar"]="A normalized grouped bar chart of the testset, showing the distribution of the distribution of times."
