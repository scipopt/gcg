# The queue is passed via $QUEUE (possibly defined in a local makefile in scip/make/local).
#
# For each run, we can specify the number of nodes reserved for a run via $PPN. If tests runs
# with valid time measurements should be executed, this number should be chosen in such a way
# that a job is run on a single computer, i.e., in general, $PPN should equal the number of cores
# of each computer. If course, the value depends on the specific computer/queue.
#
# To get the result files call "./evalcheck_cluster.sh
# results/check.$TSTNAME.$BINNAME.$SETNAME.eval in directory check/
