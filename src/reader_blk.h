/**@file   reader_blk.h
 * @brief  BLK file reader for structure information
 * @author Gerald Gamrath
 * @author Martin Bergner
 * @ingroup FILEREADERS
 *
 * This reader reads in a blk-file that defines the structur to be used for the decomposition.
 * The structure is defined variable-wise, i.e., the number of blocks and the variables belonging to each block are
 * defined. Afterwards, each constraint that has only variables of one block is added to that block,
 * constraints having variables of more than one block go into the master. If needed, constraints can also be
 * forced into the master, even if they could be transferred to one block.
 *
 * The keywords are:
 * - Presolved: to be followed by either 0 or 1 indicating that the decomposition is for the presolved or unpresolved problem
 * - NBlocks: to be followed by a line giving the number of blocks
 * - Block i with 1 <= i <= nblocks: to be followed by the names of the variables belonging to block i, one per line.
 * - Masterconss: to be followed by names of constraints, one per line, that should go into the master,
 *                even if they only contain variables of one block and could thus be added to this block.
