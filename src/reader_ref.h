 * @brief  REF file reader for structure information
 * @ingroup FILEREADERS
 * @author Gerald Gamrath
 * @author Christian Puchert
 * @author Martin Bergner
 *
 * This reader reads and writes a ref-file that defines the structur to be used for the decomposition.
 * The structure is defined constraint-wise, i.e., the number of blocks and the constraints belonging to each
 * block are defined. The constraints are numbered by the appearance in the problem.
 *
 * Constraints not mentioned in one of the blocks will remain in the master problem
 *
 * The format is the following
 * - first line: \#nblocks \#ncons_block_1 ... \#n_cons_block_n
 * - one line for each block with the indices of constraints to be put into that block separated by a comma
 *
