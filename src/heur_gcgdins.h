 * @brief  DINS primal heuristic
 * @author Robert Waniek
 *
 * DINS combines the ideas of RINS and Local Branching. It
 * defines the neighborhood by introducing a distance function between the incumbent solution and the optimum of the LP
 * relaxation. When applied during a branch-and-bound search, it further takes into account how variables change their
 * values at different nodes of the tree.
