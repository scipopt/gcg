 * @brief  master LP diving heuristic that fixes variables with a large difference to their root solution
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * Diving heuristic: Iteratively fixes some fractional variable and resolves the LP-relaxation, thereby simulating a
 * depth-first-search in the tree. Line search diving chooses the variable with the greatest difference of its root LP
 * solution and the current LP solution, hence, the variable that developed most.  It is fixed to the next integer in
 * the direction it developed. One-level backtracking is applied: If the LP gets infeasible, the last fixing is undone,
 * and the opposite fixing is tried. If this is infeasible, too, the procedure aborts.
