/**@file   reader_dec.h
 * @brief  DEC file reader for structure information
 * @author Martin Bergner
 * @author Lukas Kirchhart
 * @ingroup FILEREADERS

 * This reader reads in a dec-file that defines the structur to be used for the decomposition.
 * The structure is defined constraint-wise, i.e., the number of blocks and the constraints belonging
 * to each block are  defined.  If needed, constraints can also be  forced into the master, even if
 * they could be transferred to one block.
 *
 * The keywords are:
 * - Presolved: to be followed by either 0 or 1 indicating that the decomposition is for the unpresolved or presolved problem
 * - NBlocks: to be followed by a line giving the number of blocks
 * - Block i with 1 <= i <= nblocks: to be followed by the names of the constraints belonging to block i,
                  one per line.
 * - Masterconss: to be followed by names of constraints, one per line, that should go into the master,
 *                even if they only contain variables of one block and could thus be added to this block.
