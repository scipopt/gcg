/**@file   reader_dec.h
 * @brief  DEC file reader for structure information
 * @author Martin Bergner
 * @author Lukas Kirchhart
 * @author Micahel Bastubbe
 * @ingroup FILEREADERS-GCG

 * This reader reads and write files in .dec format. A data format to pass a (possibly partial) decomposition to GCG, prerequisite is a given MIP, whose constraints and variables are referred to by name
 * – everything behind a backslash (“\”) is a comment and is ignored
 * – information is given section-wise
 * – sections are started by key words (ignoring the case of the characters) and finished by starting a new section or reaching end of file
 * – each line in a section provides one value
 * – key words for sections are:
 *   – consdefaultmaster:
 *     – optional; followed by line with possible values: {0, 1}; default: 1; description: if set to 1 then (directly after file is read) each unassigned constraint is assigned to the master (needed for backward compatibility)
 * – presolved:
 *   – mandatory; followed by line with possible values: {0, 1}; description: if set to 0 (1) then the decomposition is considered for the unpresolved (presolved) problem
 * – nblocks
 *   – mandatory; possible values: N; description: number of (possibly empty) blocks this decomposition file has information for
 * – block (alternatives: blockconss or blockcons)
 *   – optional; directly followed by block index (starting with 1); each following line contains name of a constraint belonging to this block
 * – masterconss (alternative: mastercons)
 *   + optional; each following line contains name of a constraint belonging to the master
 * – blockvars
 *   + optional; directly followed by block index (starting with 1); each following line contains name of a variable belonging to this block
 * – mastervars (alternative: mastervar)
 *   + optional; each following line contains name of a master variable; (belongs explicitly only to master constraints)
 * – linkingvars (alternative: linkingvar)
 *   + optional; each following line contains name of a linking variable
 * – decomposition is rejected if there are any inconsistencies
 * – after reading (and and possibly assigning unassigned constraints because of consdefaultmaster, see above) implicit assignments are made:
 *   – unassigned constraints hitting at least two blocks -> assign to master;
 *   – unassigned variables hitting at least two blocks -> assign to linking ;
 * – all constraints of an unassigned variable are master constraints -> variable is master variable;
 *
