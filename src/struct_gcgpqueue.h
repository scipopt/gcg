/** priority queue data structure
 *  Elements are stored in an array, which grows dynamically in size as new elements are added to the queue.
 *  The ordering is done through a pointer comparison function.
 *  The array is organized as follows. The root element (that is the "best" element $r$ with $r <= x$ for all $x$)
 *  is stored in position 0. The children of an element at position $p$ are stored at positions $q_1 = 2*p+1$ and
 *  $q_2 = 2*p+2$. That means, the parent of the element at position $q$ is at position $p = (q-1)/2$.
 *  At any time, the condition holds that $p <= q$ for each parent $p$ and its children $q$.
 *  Insertion and removal of single elements needs time $O(log n)$.
