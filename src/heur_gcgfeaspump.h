 * @brief  Objective Feasibility Pump 2.0
 * @author Timo Berthold
 * @author Domenico Salvagnin
 *
 * The fundamental idea of the Feasibility Pump is to construct two sequences of points which hopefully converge to a
 * feasible solution. One sequence consists of LP-feasiblepoints, the other one of integer feasible points.  They are
 * produced by alternately rounding an LP-feasible point and solvng an LP that finds a point on the LP polyhedron which
 * is closest to the rounded, integral point (w.r.t. Manhattan distance).
 *
 * The version implemented in SCIP supports using an Objective Feasibility Pump that uses a convex combination of the
 * Manhattan distance and the original LP objective for reoptimization. It further features Feasibility Pump 2.0
 * capabilities, hence propagating the fixings for a faster convergence.
