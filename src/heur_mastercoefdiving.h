/**@file   heur_mastercoefdiving.h

 * @brief  master LP diving heuristic that chooses fixings w.r.t. the matrix coefficients
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * Diving heuristic: Iteratively fixes some fractional variable and resolves the LP-relaxation, thereby simulating a
 * depth-first-search in the tree. Coefficient Diving chooses the variable with the fewest locking number in any
 * direction and rounds it into this direction. One-level backtracking is applied: If the LP gets infeasible, the last
 * fixing is undone, and the opposite fixing is tried. If this is infeasible, too, the procedure aborts.
