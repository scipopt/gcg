 * @brief  master LP diving heuristic that rounds variables with long column vectors
 * @author Tobias Achterberg
 *
 * Diving heuristic: Iteratively fixes some fractional variable and resolves the LP-relaxation, thereby simulating a
 * depth-first-search in the tree. Vectorlength Diving chooses the variable with the smallest ratio of potential
 * objective change and number of affected constraints and fixes it. One-level backtracking is applied: If the LP gets
 * infeasible, the last fixings is undone, and the opposite fixing is tried. If this is infeasible, too, the procedure
 * aborts.
